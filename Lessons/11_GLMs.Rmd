## Objectives
2. Apply special cases of the GLM (ANOVA) to real datasets
3. Interpret and report the results of ANOVA in publication-style formats

## Set up
```{r, message = FALSE}
getwd()
#install.packages("agricolae")
library(tidyverse)
library(agricolae)

Litter <- read.csv("./Data/Processed/NEON_NIWO_Litter_mass_trap_Processed.csv")

# Set date to date format
Litter$collectDate <- as.Date(Litter$collectDate , format = "%Y-%m-%d")

# Set theme
mytheme <- theme_classic(base_size = 14) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = "black"), 
        legend.position = "top")
theme_set(mytheme)
```

### One-way ANOVA
A one-way ANOVA is the same test in practice as a two-sample t-test but for three or more groups. In R, we can  run the model with the function `lm` or `aov`, the latter of which which will allow us to run post-hoc tests to determine pairwise differences.

Does total litter biomass differ among sites at the Niwot Ridge LTER?
```{r}
# Wrangle the data
Litter.Totals <- Litter %>%
  group_by(plotID, collectDate, nlcdClass) %>% # have the same plotID, collectDate, nlcdClass
  summarise(dryMass = sum(dryMass)) # sum the drymass which have the same plotID, collectDate, nlcdClass?

# Test for normality. 
# Note: the important assumption for GLMs is normality of residuals, 
# not necessarily normality of raw data. See below when we plot the model.
shapiro.test(Litter.Totals$dryMass[Litter.Totals$plotID == "NIWO_040"])
shapiro.test(Litter.Totals$dryMass[Litter.Totals$plotID == "NIWO_041"])
shapiro.test(Litter.Totals$dryMass[Litter.Totals$plotID == "NIWO_046"])
shapiro.test(Litter.Totals$dryMass[Litter.Totals$plotID == "NIWO_047"])
shapiro.test(Litter.Totals$dryMass[Litter.Totals$plotID == "NIWO_051"])
shapiro.test(Litter.Totals$dryMass[Litter.Totals$plotID == "NIWO_057"])
shapiro.test(Litter.Totals$dryMass[Litter.Totals$plotID == "NIWO_058"])
shapiro.test(Litter.Totals$dryMass[Litter.Totals$plotID == "NIWO_061"])
shapiro.test(Litter.Totals$dryMass[Litter.Totals$plotID == "NIWO_062"])
shapiro.test(Litter.Totals$dryMass[Litter.Totals$plotID == "NIWO_063"])
shapiro.test(Litter.Totals$dryMass[Litter.Totals$plotID == "NIWO_064"])
shapiro.test(Litter.Totals$dryMass[Litter.Totals$plotID == "NIWO_067"])

qqnorm(Litter.Totals$dryMass); qqline(Litter.Totals$dryMass)

# Test for equal variance
# ANOVA is robust against departures from equal variance.
bartlett.test(Litter.Totals$dryMass ~ Litter.Totals$plotID)

# Format ANOVA as aov
Litter.Totals.anova <- aov(data = Litter.Totals, dryMass ~ plotID)
summary(Litter.Totals.anova) # They are significantly difference on plot ID

# Format ANOVA as lm
Litter.Totals.anova2 <- lm(data = Litter.Totals, dryMass ~ plotID)
summary(Litter.Totals.anova2) # estimate是每一个变量的系数a, 在 y=a1x1+a2x2+a3x3...

# Checking model fit and assumptions
# ANOVA is robust against departures from normality.
plot(Litter.Totals.anova2) # predictable variables

# Post-hoc test
TukeyHSD(Litter.Totals.anova) #Create a set of confidence intervals on the differences between the means of the levels of a factor with the specified family-wise probability of coverage. 

# Extract groupings for pairwise relationships
Litter.Totals.groups <- HSD.test(Litter.Totals.anova, "plotID", group = TRUE) #group = TRUE means grouping
Litter.Totals.groups # any letter match, it is not signidicantly different in this group

summary(Litter.Totals$nlcdClass)

# Graph the results
Litter.Totals.plot <- ggplot(Litter.Totals, aes(x = plotID, y = dryMass)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + # x axis is default from lower number to high                                                              # hjust = 1 define the location of text
  stat_summary(geom = "text", fun.y = max, vjust = -1, size = 3.5,
               label = c("abc", "ab", "abcd", "bcd", "bcd", "a", 
                         "d", "abcd", "cd", "d", "abcd", "abcd")) + # the lable from HSD.test, but order may differnt
  labs(x = "Plot ID", y = "Dry Mass (g)") +
  ylim(0, 85)
print(Litter.Totals.plot)
```

What information does the output give us? How might we report this information in a report?

> Total litter biomass differed significantly among sites at the Nitwot Ridge LTER (figur1: AnOVA, F(11, 198) = 4.813, p<0.0001)


### Non-parametric equivalent of ANOVA: Kruskal-Wallis Test
As with the Wilcoxon test, the Kruskal-Wallis test is the non-parametric counterpart to the one-way ANOVA. Here, the data from two or more independent samples are replaced with their ranks without regard to the grouping AND based on the between-group sum of squares calculations. 

For multiple comparisons, a p-value < 0.05 indicates that there is a significant difference between groups, but it does not indicate which groups, or in this case, months, differ from each other.

To analyze specific pairs in the data, you must use a *post hoc* test. These include the Dunn's test, a pairwise Mann-Whitney with the Bonferroni correction, or the Conover-Iman test.

```{r}
Litter.kw <- kruskal.test(Litter.Totals$dryMass ~ Litter.Totals$plotID)
Litter.kw

# There are two functions to run the Dunn Test
# dunn.test(Litter.Totals$dryMass, Litter.Totals$plotID, kw = T, 
#           table = F, list = T, method = "holm", altp = T)   #From package dunn.test
# dunnTest(Litter.Totals$dryMass, Litter.Totals$plotID)                    #From package FSA
```

## TWO-WAY ANOVA
### Main effects
A two-way ANOVA allows us to examine the effects of two categorical explanatory variables on a continuous response variable. What if we wanted to know how litter masses varied across functional groups and land cover class?

```{r}
# Format as aov
Litter.anova.2way <- aov(data = Litter, dryMass ~ functionalGroup + nlcdClass)
summary(Litter.anova.2way)

# Format as lm
Litter.anova.2way2 <- lm(data = Litter, dryMass ~ functionalGroup + nlcdClass)
summary(Litter.anova.2way2)

# Run a post-hoc test for pairwise differences
TukeyHSD(Litter.anova.2way)

```

### Interaction effects
We may expect the effects of functional group and land cover to be dependent on each other. For instance, we may expect needle biomass to be larger in evergreen forests than in other land types. In this case, we might choose to run an interaction effects two-way ANOVA, which will examine the individual effects of the explanatory variables as well as the interaction of the explanatory variables.

The output gives test statistics for each explanatory variable as well as the interaction effect of the explanatory variables. If the p-value for the interaction effect is less than 0.05, then we would consider the interaction among the explanatory variables to be significant.

```{r}
# Format as aov
Litter.anova.2way3 <- aov(data = Litter, dryMass ~ functionalGroup * nlcdClass)
summary(Litter.anova.2way3)

# Format as lm
Litter.anova.2way4 <- lm(data = Litter, dryMass ~ functionalGroup * nlcdClass)
summary(Litter.anova.2way4)

```

If the interaction is significant, we interpret pairwise differences for the interaction. If the interaction is not significant, we interpret differences for the main effects only.
```{r}
# Run a post-hoc test for pairwise differences
TukeyHSD(Litter.anova.2way3)

Litter.interaction <- with(Litter, interaction(functionalGroup, nlcdClass)) # with: specific data frame
Litter.anova.2way5 <- aov(data = Litter, dryMass ~ Litter.interaction)

Litter.groups <- HSD.test(Litter.anova.2way5, "Litter.interaction", group = TRUE)
Litter.groups # group d is very lowest bio mass

# Plot the results
# Edit this graph to make it more visually appealing.
# Add letters to represent statistical groupings.
Litter.anova.plot <- ggplot(Litter, aes(y = dryMass, x = nlcdClass, color = functionalGroup)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(geom = "text", fun.y = max, vjust = -1, size = 4, 
               label = c("d", "d", "d", "a", "d", "d"
                         , "d", "d", "d", "d", "d", "b"
                         , "d", "d", "d", "d", "d", "d"
                         , "cd", "bc", "d", "d", "d", "d"),
               position = position_dodge(width=0.75)) 
print(Litter.anova.plot)

```
